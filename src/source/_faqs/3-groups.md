question: Will the Tour be coming to my local User Group?
answer: |
    We'd be delighted to! The reality is that Tour events are still being planned and the duration and reach of the Tour will 
    be determined by the <a href="/sponsorship">support</a> of community sponsors. If you're interested in the Tour visiting your 
    User Group, <a href='/contact'>drop us a line</a>; we'll do everything we can to include you. If you're a potential 
    sponsor able to help make that a reality, we'd also love to speak with you.
